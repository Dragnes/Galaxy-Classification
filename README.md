# Galaxy-Classification

#### Overview:
One of the requirements for data science course at Galvanize is propose a capstone project testing our knowledge. My backround is in astrophysics, I did research on gas and dust particles in space, where the goal was to determine densities of certain molecules. For capstone project I decieded to stick to topic that I know I will remain focused and motivated, so I decieded to apply computer vision technique to galaxy images inorder to classify images.
Galaxy classification, started by Edwin Hubble in the 1920's. This practice is traditionally been done by human eye, there is a current project in progress where volunteers are asked to classify galaxy images (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo).
Using state of the art computer vision technique called Convolutional Neural Networks on Hubble Galaxy Images to determine a binary classification of spiral or elliptical galaxy (for simplicity, irregular galaxies were not considered).

#### Types of Galaxies:
There are three major types of galaxies:
1) Spiral galaxy: in which the stars and gas clouds are concentrated mainly in one or more spiral arms.
2) Elliptical galaxy: type of galaxy having an approximately elliposidal shape, generally void of gas and dust.
3) Irregular galaxy: galaxy that does not have a distinct regular shape.

#### Technologies used:
1) Programming language of choice was Python version 3.

    a) Jupyter is an open-source software for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
    
    b) Tensorflow is an open-source framework for Artificial Neural Networks.
    
    c) Keras is an open-source deep learning library, capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
    
2) Visualization the data using matplotlib.
3) Amazon Web Services was used exclusively for computational power, namely, EC2 instance with 2 GPUs with 16 Gib GPU Memory along wisth 32 CPUs.
4) Hubble Space Telescope Galaxy Image.
